# Hiring-Process-Analytics
Here we are trying to build a system through which we will be able to
track the number of employees we have hired in the company .
Through this hiring analytics we will measure certain parameters
which in turn will help us grow as a company and also most certainly
help in understanding our flaws. By this way the MNCs get to know
about the major underlying trends about the hiring process. These
Hiring analytics are the foundation pillar of the success of any
organisation. Trends such as- number of rejections, number of
interviews, types of jobs, vacancies etc. are important for a company
to analyse before hiring freshers or any other individual.
I have been given a dataset of a company where the details about
people who registered for a particular post in a department of this
company. Knowledge in statistics and different formulas in excel are
used to draw necessary conclusions about the company.
